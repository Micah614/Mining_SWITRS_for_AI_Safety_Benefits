The Python notebooks included in this repository are designed to extract, clean, integrate, and mine interesting patterns from the California Traffic Collision Data from SWITRS data set, which is not included in this repository due to file size limitations. 

SWITRS: “Separating Driver Classes to Estimate the Safety Benefits of AI-Corrected and AI-Autonomous Vehicles”

Artificial intelligent (AI) driving systems are a new field of automotive research that is based on extending the “awareness” of onboard automotive computing systems with an integrated sensor harness (e.g., radar, lidar, infrared, etc.) to detect current traffic conditions. The information relayed from these sensors can be used to alert the driver to dangerous conditions, or enable the vehicle to make corrective actions independently. These AI safety technologies have enormous potential for reducing the rates of common traffic collisions, preserving the life, health, and safety of vehicle passengers, bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers other motor vehicles.

○ Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers
What infomation can we data mine to see the highest cause of collisions that AI can potentially solve in the future. Which attributes cause the greatest damage and fatalities. 


○ Application of this knowledge

Numerical Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

Decision Tree Classification (DTC)

 FP-Tree Based Classification

Bayesian Belief Network (BBN Classification)
